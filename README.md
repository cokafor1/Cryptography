Program to factor large prime numbers.

In crypto analysis, it is useful to be able to factor large prime numbers. Consider it breaking one lock and getting two keys that can open it. One is a master key owned by owner of the lock and the other is second key (not an exact copy) given to anyone the master would like to have access to the lock. A person with the second key and access to the lock can now be sure that the person with the master key is the true owner of that lock. The master is also the only one who can unlock anything locked by the second person.
